myRPG (name still to decide) is a prototype of an RPG game that i'm making on my
free time to improve in JAVA.

It will have the following functions :
- You can create your own character (stats are predetermined as much as their increase by
levelling up).
- You can create a party with the characters you'll find during the adventure going from 2
to 4.
- You will have safe zones, known as towns to rest free and buy merchandises.
- You will be able to travel around the world and fight monsters following a scenario.
- You will have a story to follow with dialogues but no cinematics
- you will have a menu to set your equipement, see your stats etc
- you will have a saving system (so you can load your game).
